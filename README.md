# Simple Linear Regression - Manual Implementation
## 📚 Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a Simple Linear Regression model from scratch in Python. Instead of using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for regression, this notebook walks through the mathematical logic behind calculating the regression line.

The purpose of this project is to understand the internal workings of linear regression, including how the slope and intercept are calculated and how predictions are made.

## 🔑 Key Features
📐 Manual calculation of regression coefficients (slope and intercept)

🔍 Simple, readable Python class (LRManual) for learning and experimentation

⚙️ Uses only NumPy and pandas for data handling (no inbuilt ML algorithms)

🛡️ Example dataset loading and train-test split using scikit-learn (for splitting only, not modeling)
